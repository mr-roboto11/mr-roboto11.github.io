  <p>I cant speak for everybody when I say, "I hate working at stressful, mundane, uneventful, frivilous, menial places. With people who souls have started to reflect the very situations in which they work, live, or operate." This type of enviroment is no place for the likes of those who wish to live a life of their own creation. These are the places where hate, envy, and jealousy lives...  Where any dream that might have been has now died. A place too dim for that quality real hustlers possess that makes them thrive!

  <p>Navigating the business world requires more than just strategic planning and hard work‚Äîit demands discernment in choosing who to surround yourself with. In any professional setting, the people you interact with can either propel you toward success or drag you down into setbacks and missed opportunities. While it's important to collaborate with talented and driven individuals, it's equally crucial to recognize and steer clear of those who can undermine your efforts. </p>
  <p>
    In this article, we'll explore the types of people you should avoid in business‚Äîthose whose behaviors and attitudes can hinder your progress, derail your goals, and even jeopardize your reputation. Whether you're just starting out or are an experienced professional, being aware of these potential pitfalls can help you cultivate a network that supports your growth and ambition.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you navigate the complexities of business relationships, being able to identify and distance yourself from detrimental influences is key to maintaining your momentum and focus. Understanding the characteristics of these individuals can save you time, energy, and resources. Let's delve into some specific examples of the types of people you should avoid in business, so you can better protect your ambitions and ensure your path to success remains clear.

    <h1 id="typeMargin" style="background-color: rgb(166, 166, 166); box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px black;">The Naysayer</h1>
    <!-- <img src="/naysayer-blk-wht.png" alt=""> -->

      <p>
        As the name suggests, these are the people filled with doubt. Entrepreneurs should be fueled by ambition, faith, and hope‚Äîqualities that drive them to turn dreams into reality. Naysayers, however, lack these essential traits. They either don‚Äôt believe in your ability to achieve your goals or are so consumed by their own fears and limitations that they project them onto you. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Avoid naysayers like the plague because they will plant seeds of doubt in your mind. They‚Äôll list every possible reason why your ideas won‚Äôt work, why your goals are too ambitious, and why you can't succeed. Over time, their negativity can erode your confidence and stifle your creativity, leaving you second-guessing yourself at every turn. To protect your vision and keep your momentum, it‚Äôs crucial to distance yourself from these pessimistic voices and surround yourself with those who encourage and uplift you instead.

    <p> 
      Beware of <b>These Jealous Individuals</b>. Jealousy is a powerful and destructive emotion, and these people are consumed by it. Their feelings stem from a dark and malicious place, and they are envious of you and your entrepreneurial endeavors. If you don‚Äôt distance yourself from them, they will malevolently tear apart your character, reputation, business, and dreams. These individuals are often disguised as family, friends, coworkers, or even people on your social media friends list.
    </p>
    <p>
      This type is particularly dangerous because they are most likely to engage in volatile and spiteful actions against you. They might steal your possessions, spread blatant and disrespectful lies, falsely accuse you of things you‚Äôve never done, and go out of their way to undermine your business in any manner possible. These people are a cancer to your success, and if you don‚Äôt rid yourself of their toxic presence, you‚Äôll find everything you‚Äôve worked towards slowly deteriorating. Protect yourself and your dreams by cutting ties with these individuals before their envy destroys what you‚Äôve built.

  <p> 
    This type falls somewhere between a narcissist and an only child‚Äîthe world revolves around them, or so they believe. If you have the misfortune of being in their presence, be prepared for a daily competition to prove who‚Äôs superior. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a love interest, family member, coworker, or a total stranger‚Äîthe Center of Attention needs everyone's admiration, likes, praise, and love. They want you to succeed, just not more than them. Your achievements and efforts will always play a secondary role to their ever-inflated ego.

  <p> 
    The Affluent Lame has money, capital, and possibly a great network of associates. These are the types of people who may have been overlooked or underestimated for most of their lives, but now that they have money, they believe it‚Äôs all that matters. Steer clear, or be prepared to be annoyed like never before. The Affluent Lame uses their wealth to control situations, often hiring others to disrupt your business or overshadow your efforts. In true lame fashion, they‚Äôll boast about it with a braggadocious bravado, using their financial power as a crutch to compensate for their lack of genuine influence or character.

    "What exactly do you do?" 
  </p>
  <p>"Do you have a degree?"</p>
  <p>"Is it an Associate‚Äôs or a Bachelor‚Äôs?"</p>
  <p>"How long have you been doing this?"</p>
  <p>"Do you know how to do XYZ because that other business knows How?"</p">

  <p>This type of person is the living embodiment of the phrase "death by comparison." They will bombard you with a barrage of pestering questions, all designed to make you feel inadequate or unworthy. No matter how many credentials you possess, nothing will satisfy their pseudo-inquisitiveness. In their eyes, they‚Äôve already passed judgment‚Äîthey‚Äôre just going through their mental checklist to confirm it.
  </p>
  <p>
    This type is definitely annoying, constantly trying to undermine your confidence and competence. The best way to handle them is to turn their tactics back on them. Offset their invasive questions with your own: "Do you have a degree?" "Can you provide an invoice?" This not only deflects their attempts to belittle you but also puts them on the defensive, revealing the shallow nature of their inquiries. Remember, their aim is to compare you to others, but you don‚Äôt need to play their game. Stay confident in your own path, and don‚Äôt let their doubts shake your resolve.</p>

    <p>Is that my shadow, my clone, or a doppelg√§nger? No, it‚Äôs my human carbon copy. Beware of this type especially‚Äîthey are the sneaks of the bunch, lying in wait like bear traps. One wrong step, and they have your entire business plan. This type may even be a fellow entrepreneur! You‚Äôll find them in places like Barnes & Noble, Starbucks, the local library, or workspace, pretending to hustle while they "fake it till they make it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference between you and them is that they never had a dream of their own. They operate on a hustle they likely copied from someone else. These individuals jump from industry to industry, mimicking the success of others without any original vision. Their sole objective is money, money, money! If your business, endeavors, or goals seem like they might be commercially successful, "Mr. and Mrs. Me Too" will be right there, imitating everything you do. Think of them like a virus‚Äîkeep your distance, and guard your ideas closely.</p>

      <p>Sometimes people laugh to hide their pain, and this may be the case with this type. Either that, or they have some serious issues to work through. But what's so funny about making money? Where's the joke in being an entrepreneur? Why am I a joke to you?
      </p>
      <p>
        Would you want to be around someone who thinks your ambitions are a punchline? The real joke is that these individuals are often deeply unhappy, and instead of addressing the problems in their own lives, they choose to laugh at your entrepreneurial hardships as a way to medicate their miserable souls. Like the hyenas of the African safari, these scavengers run in packs, cackling at any and everything they can. Steer clear of these clowns, or you risk becoming part of their circus. Your business is serious, and you deserve to be surrounded by people who respect that, not those who treat your efforts like a comedy routine.</p>

     <p>Some people operate with an abundance mindset, while others are trapped in a scarcity mindset. The difference between the two can often determine whether a person thrives or struggles. The individual with a poor mindset will always remain poor, not because of their circumstances, but because of how they think. This type of person is a self-sabotaging entity, stuck in a cycle of scarcity that they can‚Äôt seem to break free from.
     </p>
     <p>
       They don‚Äôt understand the concept of value‚Äîeither in themselves or in the opportunities around them. Their poor spending habits and lack of discipline in saving make it impossible for them to build wealth or security. They live without any kind of plan, drifting aimlessly through life. While Jesus might have a plan for them, they certainly don‚Äôt have one for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
      For these reasons, it‚Äôs imperative that you keep your distance from such individuals. To them, you represent money; your business assets are nothing more than items to be pawned off for quick cash. They might not see the worth in your hard work, but they‚Äôll definitely see an opportunity to exploit it‚Äîespecially when their rent is due. Protect yourself and your business by steering clear of those who can only bring you down with their scarcity mentality. Surround yourself with people who share your vision of abundance and growth, and who will help elevate your success, not drain it.</p>

    <p>This type is perhaps the only one that‚Äôs relatively harmless to be around. Gather around the fire, everyone, and let me tell you a tale of a time when people worked at the same job for 30 years. A land where "mail" meant actual paper letters, and the internet was a distant dream. There were no social media influencers, no social media platforms, and certainly no one getting rich from twerking online (‚Ä¶I‚Äôm just saying).
    </p>
    <p>
      These individuals belong to a different era, one that‚Äôs far removed from the fast-paced, digital world of today‚Äôs entrepreneurship. They won‚Äôt understand any of your new-age entrepreneurial ‚Äúcommunist voodoo,‚Äù as they might call it. The concepts of remote work, digital marketing, or making money online might seem foreign or even absurd to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, don‚Äôt dismiss them entirely. Although they might not grasp the nuances of modern business, they carry valuable insights about the old-school hustle. They know the importance of hard work, persistence, and integrity‚Äîqualities that are timeless in any entrepreneurial journey. While they may not be your go-to for advice on navigating today‚Äôs business landscape, their wisdom can offer perspective and grounding in an ever-changing world.</p>

    <p>Forrest Gump had a memorable saying: "Stupid is as stupid does." The meaning behind this is that a person‚Äôs actions reflect their level of intelligence and understanding. In other words, an unintelligent person can only achieve as much as their knowledge and skills allow them to‚Äîif that makes sense. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In business, speed is crucial, and entrepreneurship is a complex endeavor. Intelligence‚Äîboth cognitive and emotional‚Äîis essential. While having significant capital might allow you to delegate tasks and mitigate some challenges, emotional intelligence is still required to navigate interpersonal relationships and make sound decisions.
    </p>
    <p> 
      Dealing with individuals who lack these qualities can derail your dreams and lead to significant setbacks. Small minds tend to engage in small-minded conversations, such as gossip, and exhibit short-sightedness due to a lack of vision. They may also display impatience and a tendency for loyalty to shift based on opportunity, rather than commitment.
    </p>
    <p>
      When engaging with such individuals, it‚Äôs crucial to be cautious. Their lack of intelligence and foresight can lead to unforeseen complications, turning them into dependents you never intended to have. Be strategic and discerning in your interactions to avoid unnecessary pitfalls and ensure your focus remains on achieving your goals.

    <p>Someone once told me, "Money.Is.A.Major.Issue", and you know what? He was right. I just didn't know how or what he was right about yet. This is what I gathered, it's not just all about the physical money. It's about how money makes people feel too. To a wimp, money might make he/she feel like they're better than everyone they meet. To the shopaholic, it might give them access to buy more things. I don't have to go in detail but you get the gist. PEOPLE USE MONEY TO ATTAIN THEIR DEEPEST WANTS AND DESIRES. To a real Entrepreneur or <b>Hustler</b> (<em style="color:red;">anyone who uses their skills to get money or attain their ambitions</em>) money is the means to make more capital.</p> <p>To invest in their business or company. Business 101, right!? Don't cast your stones to swine in this situation. Having every new popular basketball shoe is not your ambition... keeping up with the Jones' is not your objective... To have a million social media friends is not your goal... having a million potential customers is! Doing what they said you couldn't do is the goal! The Entrepreneur chooses to pursue a higher calling. They didn't settle for mediocrity and decide to "take it out on the world." They chose to do what naysayers said "couldn't be done." They chose to run torwards the light, not from it. They Choose to be Fearless about their Goals!</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Remember you are chasing your dreams. That means you have to take the 'first step.' If you wait on someone else's advice, they may give you the wrong advice. If you wait on the permission of others they'll keep you on standby until they feel "your ready." Everybody has an opinion, especially people that's never done ANYTHING for you. Nobody cares about your finances unless they benefit from it.</p><h1 style="background-color: #000;">It's up to you to make it happen.</h1>
