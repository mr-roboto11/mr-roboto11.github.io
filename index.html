  <h2>The Tumultuous Task of being a Black Web Developer</h2>
<hr>    
  <p>I cant speak for most everybody when I say, " I hate working at stressful, mundane, uneventful, frivilous, menial places. With people who souls have started to reflect the very situations in with they work." This type of enviroment is no place for the likes of those who wish to live a life of their own creation. This is the place where hate, envy, and jealousy lives...  Where any dream that might have been has now died. A place to dim for that quality real hustlers posess that makes them thrive! That thing that a $100,000 <sub>degree</sub> couldn't teach! You have to have...‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• AMBITION! THAT FIRE!! AND A DREAM OF YOUR OWN!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•</p>

    <h2>Money This, Money That</h2>
    <p>Someone once told me, " Money, Is, A, Major, Issue ", and you know what? He was right. I just didn't know how or what he was right about yet. This is what I gathered, it's not just all about the physical money. It's about how money makes people feel too. To a wimp, money might make him feel like he's better than everyone who ever kicked his a$$ or teased him. To the shopaholic, it might be access to more things to buy. I don't have to go in detail but you get the jist. PEOPLE USE MONEY TO ATTAIN THEIR DEEPEST WANTS AND DESIRES. To a real Entrepreneur or Hustler (<em>anyone who uses their skills to get money or attain their ambitions</em>) money is the means to make more capital. To invest in their business or company. Business 101, right!? Don't cast your stones to swine in this situation. Having every new popular basketball shoe is not your ambition... keeping up with the Jones' is not your objective... To have a million social media friends is not your goal... having a million potential customers is. Doing what they said you couldn't do is the goal! The Entrepreneur chooses to pursue a higher calling. They didn't settle for mediocrity and decided to "take it out on the world." They choose to do what naysayers said "couldn't be done. "They chose to run torwards the light, not from it. They Choose to be Fearless about their Goals! People who are always talking about money, they're usually never really talking about money...</p>
