  <h2>The Tumultuous Task of being a Black Entrepreneur</h2>
<hr>    
  <p>I cant speak for everybody when I say, "I hate working at stressful, mundane, uneventful, frivilous, menial places. With people who souls have started to reflect the very situations in which they work, live, or operate." This type of enviroment is no place for the likes of those who wish to live a life of their own creation. These are the places where hate, envy, and jealousy lives...  Where any dream that might have been has now died. A place too dim for that quality real hustlers possess that makes them thrive! That thing that a <b style="color:rgb(76, 207, 33)">$100,000 degree</b> couldn't teach! You have to have...</p>

      <p>
      Just like the name entails, these are the people filled with doubt. Entreprneurs should be filled with ambition, faith, and hope. The naysayers are devoid of these three qualities and/or don't think you are able to achieve your goals. Either way, avoid this type like the black plague because they will fill your mind with <b>doubt</b>. They'll tell you every reason it can't be done and why you can't do it.

    <p> 
    Beware of these <b>jealous</b> mfs. Their feelings come from an evil place. They are mad at you and/or your entreprenuerial endeavors. They will malelovently destroy your character, reputation, business, and your dreams to shreds if you don't avoid them. They are disguised as family, friends, co-workers, and people on your social media friends list. This type is most likely to do some volatile sh*t to you; steal you items, tell blantant disrespectful lies, blame you for things you've never done, and disrespect your business any way they can. Rid your self of these cancerous bunch or you will find everything you work torwards deteriorate.

  <p> 
  This type is somewhere in between a narcissist and an only child. The sun itself revolves around this type. Be prepared to have a pissing contest everyday if you have the misfortune of being in their presence. No matter if it's a love interest, family member, co-workers, or total strangers. The center of attention will need everyones admiration, likes, praises, and love. They want you to do good, just not better than them. You and your endeavors will always be a "co-star" to their ego.

  <p> 
The Affluent Lame has money, capital, and may have a great network of associates. These are the types of people who've been lame for most of their life but now that they have money, so "It don't matter." Steer clear or get ready to be annoyed like never before. The affluent lame will use money to control any situation they can. They can use their hired help to assist with disrupting your business. In true lame fashion, they'll have a braggadocio bravado about it all.

  <p>Do you know how to do XYZ because that other business knows How?</p">

  <p>This type is the living embodiment of "to die by comparison." They will bombard you with an array of pestering questions in an attempt to deem you unworthy. There is no amount of crendentials you can possess to appease their psuedo-inquisitiveness because in their eyes they have already passed judgement. They are just going through their "mental checklist" to confirm it. This type is definetely annoying. Offset their questions with questions; "Do you have a degree?", "Do you have an invoice"</p>

    <p>Is that my shadow, my clone, or a doppleganger? No, it's my human carbon copy. Beware of this type especially. They are the sneaks of the bunch who wait around like bear traps. One wrong step and they have your whole business plan. This type may even be a fellow entreprenuer! You'll find them in the Barnes & Noble, Starbucks, the local library, or workspace faking it till they make it. The difference between you and them, is that they never had a dream. They have a hustle they may have copied from someone else. They will jump from industry to industry, mimmicking. Their goal is money, money, money! If your business, endeavors, or goals seem like they may be a commercial success. "Mr and Mrs Me Too" will be right there doing everything you do. Think of them like Covid. Isolate yourself and keep something over your mouth.</p>

      <p>Sometimes people laugh to hide the pain. This may be the case with this type. That or they have some serious mental issues. What's so funny about making money? Where's the joke in being an entreprenuer? Why am I a joke to you? Would you want to be around someone who thinks you and your endeavors are a joke? The real joke is that they are sad but instead of addressing whatever is wrong in their boring lives. They have decided to laugh at your entreprenuerial hardships and use it as medicine for their miserable souls. Like the hyenas of the african safari, these scavengers run in packs, cackling at any and everything they can. Steer clear of these <u>clowns</u> or you'll become part of the circus. </p>

     <p> Some people have an abundance mindset and some have a scarcity mindset. The poor minded individual will always be poor because of the way they think. This type is a self-sabotaging entity that operates in a scarcity mindset. They don't understand value. They have bad spending habits. They have bad saving habits. They don't have any type of plan. Jesus might have a plan for them but they don't have one for themselves. For these reasons it is imperative you stay away from them. You look like money to them, your business assets look like pawn shop items, not to mention their rent is due.</p>

    <p>Forest Gump had a great saying, "Stupid is as Stupid Does" or something like that. Meaning, an unintelligent person can only do as much as they know how to do (...if that makes sense). Business is fast. Being an entreprenuer is an intricate thing. Intelligence is required, unless you have the good fortune to delegate all task because you have a lot of capital. Emotional intelligence is also required. So dealing with people who don't possess these qualities will send your dreams crashing and burning. Small minds. Small-minded conversations (<em>Gossip</em>). Short-sightedness (<em>Lack of Vision</em>). Inpatience. Loyalty switches based on opportunity. Be smart when dealing with this type or you'll have a dependent you didn't ask for.

    <h2>Money This, Money That</h2>
    <p>Someone once told me, "Money.Is.A.Major.Issue", and you know what? He was right. I just didn't know how or what he was right about yet. This is what I gathered, it's not just all about the physical money. It's about how money makes people feel too. To a wimp, money might make he/she feel like they're better than everyone they meet. To the shopaholic, it might give them access to buy more things. I don't have to go in detail but you get the gist. PEOPLE USE MONEY TO ATTAIN THEIR DEEPEST WANTS AND DESIRES. To a real Entrepreneur or <b>Hustler</b> (<em style="color:red;">anyone who uses their skills to get money or attain their ambitions</em>) money is the means to make more capital.</p> <p>To invest in their business or company. Business 101, right!? Don't cast your stones to swine in this situation. Having every new popular basketball shoe is not your ambition... keeping up with the Jones' is not your objective... To have a million social media friends is not your goal... having a million potential customers is! Doing what they said you couldn't do is the goal! The Entrepreneur chooses to pursue a higher calling. They didn't settle for mediocrity and decide to "take it out on the world." They chose to do what naysayers said "couldn't be done." They chose to run torwards the light, not from it. They Choose to be Fearless about their Goals!</p>

<br>

<h2>Did I ask you for any money?</h2>
<p><b style="color:red">No</b>, I funded myself. When I wasn't able to fund myself, I sought out the help of financial institutions and/or organizations that specialize in helping businesses in that particular sector.</p>

<h2>Did I ask you to do my taxes?</h2>

<h2>Did I ask you to itemize my taxes?</h2>

<br>

<h2>Did I ask you to use your vehicle?</h2>

<br>

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Remember you are chasing your dreams. That means you have to take the 'first step.' If you wait on someone else's advice, they may give you the wrong advice. If you wait on the permission of others they'll keep you on standby until they feel "your ready." Everybody has an opinion, especially people that's never done ANYTHING for you. Nobody cares about your finances unless they benefit from it.</p><h1 style="background-color: #000;">It's up to you to make it happen.</h1>
